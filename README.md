- Data Summary Reporting and Visualisation Pipeline for crop yield prediction ------------------------------------

# Project Overview
This project enables data analysts to generate automated reports and visualizations to summarize modelled data. It is designed to be flexible, catering to different users, including non-technical stakeholders like plant breeders.

The project includes Python and R implementations, with a focus on making reporting adaptable based on user roles. This README provides instructions on setup, usage, and a brief overview of the functionality.


# Features
Data Loading and Preprocessing: Load and clean data from a zipped dataset.
Automated Reports: Generate summary statistics, visualizations, and customizable reports.
Role-Based Reporting: Adapt report detail based on user roles (e.g., analyst, breeder).
Monitoring and Flexibility: Log processes, handle errors, and provide options for scheduled monitoring.

# Quick start
Clone the repo
install dependencies -- pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the main file for generating report

# Monitoring and Flexibility
The pipeline includes basic logging and error handling, with options for continuous monitoring (e.g., using cron jobs or Airflow). It is modular and can be extended for more complex reporting needs
